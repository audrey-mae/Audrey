<h2> Frida is a power player. She's adventurous and energetic, always the first one to grab a treat or run out of my sight. </h2>

	<p> Also, she's my favorite because she gives the most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUwDli-USiA">kisses. </a> Rats are very <a href="https://www.peta.org/features/hidden-lives-rats-mice/"> intelligent, </a> and they know and love their human companions. </p>

<p>Frida used to steal food from <a href="Artemis.html"> Artemis. </a> Sometimes I had to separate them at dinnertime to make sure Artemis got any food in her tiny body. They seem to have learned to share now that they're adults. </p>

<p> I named her after one of my favorite female artists, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frida_Kahlo">Frida Kahlo.  </a>   Although Artemis and Frida have been together their whole lives, they both been great sports in opening their home to <a href="lunaandsoleil.html"> Luna and Soleil.</a>

<p> Frida loves to run around inside my jackets, and I think its funny to walk around with no one knowing she's in there. </p>
