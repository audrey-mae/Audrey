<p> <a href="frida.html"> Frida </a> is the alpha. </p>
<p> <a href="artemis.html"> Artemis </a> is her slightly more laid back adopted sister. 
<p> And somehow <a href="lunaandsoleil.html"> Luna and Soleil, </a> formerly my little sister's rats, entered my custody as well. I've got a whole pack on my hands. (And if Luna's fatness end up being pregnant-ness, well... I'm not sure what I'll do.)

<p>We've been on a lot of <a href="ratapalooza.html">adventures </a> together. Sometimes they're like tiny fuzzy <a href="ratapalooza.html">emotional support</a> beanbags. They've also pooped on a lot of my stuff and chewed a hole in my down comforter, and they keep me up at night with their squeaky <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality">nocturnal antics.</a> But I love them anwyay.</p>
