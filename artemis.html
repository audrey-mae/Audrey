	<h2> Artemis, or Farty Arty for short, is the old man of the group. (Despite the fact that they are all girls). </h2> 
	<p> Like Frida, I named her after a female artist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_Gentileschi"> Artemisia Gentileschi, </a> but shortened it for ease of pronunciation and in reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis"> goddess of the hunt. </a> </p>

	<p> I call her the old man because she's skinny and shy and I sometimes worry about her health. She can usually be found chillin' in the corner, eyes half closed as if she's stoned, disinterested in Frida's antics. </p>

	<p> Once I made her a vet appointment after Googling the seeming respiratory symptoms she exhibited in the video above. (I concluded she had a deadly <a href="https://www.petmd.com/exotic/conditions/viral/c_ex_rt_lymphocytic_choriomeningitis_virus">rat virus </a> which would take out all the other rats and could even infect me.) Fortunately, she was healthy again once the appointment came around, saving me $56 and my imagined case of rat brain fever!  <p>

<p> Artemis and <a href="frida.html"> Frida</a> have been best friends since I got them as a pair of babies. They were so small I almost thought I'd been conned into buying mice, but now that they've more than doubled in size, I'm pretty certain they're rats. </p> 

<p> I feed them a daily diet of pet store kibbles, but supplement with fruits, veggies, and grains for nutritious <a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-pet-rats-1238500"> treats </a> to round out their diets (read: to make them love me.)
